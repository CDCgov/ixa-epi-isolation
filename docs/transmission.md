# Modeling Transmission
An infectious individual (infector) attempts to infect other individuals that they are in contact during their infection (infectee). The mechanism that generates this these infection attempts is referred to as the infection propagation loop (implemented in `infection_propagation_loop.rs`). Supporting implementation to construct the infection loop is implemented in `infectiousness_manager.rs`. The objective of the transmission modules is to model time-varying infectiousness.

## Time-varying Infectiousness
The model maintains a functional representation of infector's infectiousness rate over their infection called the `infectiousness_rate_fn`. This implementation bypasses the common epidemological assumption that the time between infection attempts is exponentially distributed. It enables infectiousness to be informed by individual level viral-load trajectories. There are two supported ways to define `infectiousness_rate_fn`.

### `Constant`
A constant infectiousness rate function is defined by a rate parameter `r` and duration parameter, `infection_duration`. An individual's infectiousness rate does not vary during their infection. Using this approach results in the traditional exponentially distributed time between infection attempts.

### `EmpiricalFromFile`
Inidividual level infectiousness rate trajectories can be provided in a file. The file must contain `id`, `time`, `value` columns, where `time` and `value` entries are data points of the functional resprestation for a given curve `id`. Linear interpolation is used between data points. A `scale` parameter is also required for this implementation which is a constant multiplier on the `value` column, effectly increasing or decreasing all infectiousness rate trajectories.

## Transmission Modifiers
Transmission modifiers are multipliers that scale an individiauls infectiousness rate function similarly to the `scale` parameter of `EmpiricalFromFile`. A transmission modifier is associated directly with an `InfectionStatus` value and a person property, the effects of transmission modifiers are automatically handled by the `transmission_modifier_manager.rs`. An individual's total transmission mulitiplier, also referred to as the relative total transmission, is the product of all active individual transmission modifiers given the individual's `InfectionStatus` and person property values. Masks are the primary use case of transmission modifiers in the model. They are associated with the `InfectionStatus::Infectious` value and a Boolean `MaskingStatus` person property.

There are inherent transmission modifiers outside of those associated with person properties. As discussed in [settings documentation](settings.md), settings implement density dependent transmission modifiers governed by setting category specific parameters $\alpha$ and take the form $(N-1)^\alpha$. For an individual's active itinerary, a transmission modifier is created that is the weighted average of the densitiy dependent transmission modifiers. The weights are the proportion of time the individual spends in the setting. The largest setting specific modifier is tracked across both default and modified itineraries for an individual. Another inherent transmission modifier is in place with individuals at are asymptomatic. This is governed by the input parameter `relative_infectiousness_asymptomatics`.

## Forecasting Infection Attempts
When interventions (e.g., transmission modifiers and itinerary modifiers) are activated relative to an individuals infection introduces complexity that must be addressed when generating infection attempts with time-varying rates. It is not possible know how an individual's infectiousness rate function will change due to modifiers over the course of their infection duration. This motivates using a rejection sampling approach in which forecasted infection attempts are generated using the individual's maximum infectiousness curve. This curve is defined as the individual's infectiousness curve scaled by the largest setting specific modifiers. At the time of the forecasted infection attempt the individual's actual infectiousness can be calculated as the product of their infectiousness curve and all transmission modifiers. The forecast is then evaluated to be successul with probability equivalent to the ratio of the current and maximum infectiousness. If the forecasted infection attempt is successful the remainder of the infection propagation loop is executed.

Given an individual's maximum infectiousness curve and some elapsed time into the infection duration, $t$ the next forecasted infection is stochastically generated using inverve transform sampling. Firstly a number of events to occur is sampled from an exponential distribution with rate one. Secondly the time for that number of events the time for that number of events to occur is calcuated using the cumulative rates that have occurred so far.

## Infection Propagation Loop
There are multiple steps and conditions that are checked during the infection propagation loop. At the time a forecasted infection attempt is successful for a given infector, a setting is sampled from the infectors active itinerary with probability proportional to normalized ratio values of the itinerary. From the sampled setting, an infectee is sampled from the set of active individuals. Once the infectee is selected, their infection status is checked, if the individual is not susceptible, then the infection attempt is unsuccessful. Transmission modifiers can be used used to reduce susceptibility as well, so the relative total transmission for the infectee is calcuated, and the infection attempt is successful with probability equal to the relative total transmission. If the infection attempt is successful then the person is moved from `InfectionStatus::Susceptible` to `InfectionStatus::Infectious`. This event triggers plans to be created which recover the individual at some point in the future and begin their [symptom progression](symptom-progression.md).
