# Creating Modeling Experiments
A calibration and scenarios framework is available to run complex analyses using `ixa-epi-isolation`. The framework can be easily applied to other models as well. The calibration scenarios framework is established through an example in `experiments/simple-fits/wyoming-incidence/`. Other examples of model calibration exist in `experiments/simple-fits/recreate-synthetic/`. Scenario-based performance benchmarking is also available in `experiments/examples/benchmarking/`

Our primary used case for the model was calibrated to incidence hospitalization in Wyoming over the 2020-2021 respiratory season, and a counterfactual analysis was conducted studying the effect of the updated and previous isolation guidance. This is available in `experiments/simple-fits/wyoming-incidence/`. The calibration procedure applied approximate Bayesian computation with sequential Monte Carlo (ABC-SMC) using negative log Poisson likelihood to compare simulated and observed weekly incidence hospitalizations. ABC-SMC produces a posterior estimate of calibrated parameters. The calibrated posterior estimates are then used in combination with a [griddle](https://github.com/CDCgov/pygriddler) of scenarios in which updated and previous guidance are evaluated with different levels of policy adherence and masking efficacy. This experiment can be fully reproduced by running sequentially the scripts `experiments/simple-fits/wyoming-incidence/scripts/abc.py` and `experiments/simple-fits/wyoming-incidence/scripts/scenarios.py`. Visualizations (post running the experiment) and more details of the experiment can be found by generating the `experiments/simple-fits/wyoming-incidence/docs/output.qmd` quarto document.

Additional guidance on running in the various `README.md` files at different levels of the experiments directory.
