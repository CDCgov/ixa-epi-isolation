# Model Objective
The goal of the `ixa-epi-isolation` model is to compare the updated and previous COVID-19 isolation guidance policies. We refer to the updated isolation guidance as the broader pan-respiratory guidance policy recommended for COVID-19 in March 2024, and the previous isolation guidance policy as the policy in place immediately before the updated isolation guidance policy. This work seeks to incorporate the outcomes of the [individual-level, hierarchical model analysis of isolation guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-behind-the-model/php/data-research/covid-isolation/index.html) into an agent-based model with community level transmission. It is informed by similar data sources, resulting in non-trivial approaches to model development. The model itself can be used provide calibration and scenarios experiment framework to conduct epidemiological analysis.
