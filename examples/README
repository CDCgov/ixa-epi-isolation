The `examples` directory contains some simple exercises and best practices for using the
`abmwrappers` python package with `ixa-epi-isolation`.

## Getting started
Be sure to activate the poetry environment by running `poetry install` and, if packages don't
appear, running `$(poetry env activate)`.

Build the current release binaries by executing `cargo build --release`

Ensure that you can run the release from the command line by running
```
target/release/epi-isolation -c input/input.json
```
Note that if the files already exist in the root directory, you will only be able to run the above
command by including the force overwrite argument `-f`

### Rendering `quarto` docs
Install (quarto)[https://docs.posit.co/resources/install-quarto.html] and ensure that your poetry
environemnt is activated. Verify you can run quarto with `quarto check install`.

To render a doc, use `quarto render path/to/file/output.qmd`

### Replicate core example
Here, we set up a replicate of the core example and then we plot the results in a quarto document.
An analogous python script is included to demonstrate use of the scripts file hierarchy.

This example serves to run 30 replicates of the `input/input.json` file and plot the counts by
infection status over time.

To run the example using only python, use the command

```
poetry run python examples/replicate-core-example/scripts/replicate.py -v
```

To create a quarto md doc, use the command

```
quarto render examples/replicate-core-example/docs/output.qmd
```
